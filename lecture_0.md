# 🐍 Python Programming Basics: Your First Steps
To improve viewability: ⌘ + Shift + V
## 🖥️ Getting Started with VS Code

- VS Code is a text editor where you can write code, browse files, and run terminal commands.
- Use the terminal to run your Python files (like hello.py).
- Typing print statements is the traditional first step when learning any language.
- Python translates human-readable code into binary (0s and 1s) for the computer.
- Running a Python file executes the commands inside it. 🎉 Your first program!

## 🧠 Functions = Built-In Actions

- Functions are actions that Python already knows how to perform.
- print is a function that displays messages in the terminal.
- Functions can take arguments (like what to print).

## 🐞 Bugs Are Normal

- Bugs are mistakes or problems in your code — they’re part of the process.
- The interpreter will show errors when something’s wrong.
- Error messages help you debug, but they’re not always obvious. Stay patient! 🧩

## 📦 Variables = Named Boxes for Data

- A variable stores information for later use.
- You assign values to variables using the equals sign.
- The value on the right is stored inside the name on the left.

## 💬 Comments & 🧾 Pseudocode

- Comments are notes inside your code for yourself or other programmers.
- They don’t affect how the code runs.
- Pseudocode is a way to plan logic before writing real code — like a to-do list for solving problems.

## 💡 Improving Output Formatting

- Instead of printing on separate lines, you can make output appear on the same line.
- Functions like print can take multiple arguments for cleaner output.

## 🧵 Strings and Parameters

- A string (or str) is just text.
- Functions like print have parameters that change how they behave.
- The print function normally adds a new line — but that can be changed with a setting.
- Parameters are optional values that influence function behavior.

## ❗ Dealing with Quotation Marks

- Including quotation marks inside strings can cause errors.
- Use special characters (like a backslash) or switch quote styles to fix this.

## ✨ f-Strings = Elegant String Insertion

- f-Strings are the cleanest way to insert variables into text.
- They’re readable and used very often in Python.

## 🧼 Cleaning Up User Input

- Users often type input with extra spaces or inconsistent capitalization.
- Use built-in string methods to clean up input:
  - strip removes extra spaces
  - title capitalizes each word
- These can be chained together for concise, readable code.

## 🔢 Integers = Whole Numbers

- Input is treated as text, even if it looks like a number.
- Convert strings to integers when doing math.
- This process is called casting — temporarily changing data types.

## 🪄 Readability Wins

- Many coding styles may be valid — the best one is the most readable.
- Use comments and spacing to make your code easy to follow.

## 🌊 Floats = Numbers with Decimals

- Floats are real numbers with decimal points.
- Input can be converted to floats when needed.
- You can round floats to a specific number of decimal places.
- f-Strings can format floats to show exactly how you want them to appear.
- You can even display large numbers with commas for clarity.

## 🛠️ Creating Your Own Functions

- Functions let you define reusable actions.
- You define functions with a name and optional parameters.
- Python uses indentation to know which lines belong to the function.
- You can set default values for parameters in your custom functions.
- Functions can be organized into a main function for structure.

## 🚀 Calling Main to Run Your Program

- Creating a function doesn’t run it — you have to call it!
- A main function helps organize your program, but you must remember to call it at the bottom.

## 🔁 Returning Values from Functions

- Functions can return values back to the part of the program that called them.
- This is useful when you want to calculate something and use that result later.
- return lets a function send data back instead of printing it.
